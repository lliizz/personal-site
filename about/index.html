                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>Originally from Boise, Idaho, I’ve now made my home base in Manassas, Virginia, 
                            with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in animation. 
                            As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could 
                            get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site 
                            to fit my own specific needs.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to 
                            build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility 
                            I was looking for in my work. Now I’ve made a full switch to front-end development, 
                            where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>
